    "genetic-algorithm": {
      "name": "Genetic Algorithm",
      "description": "A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation."

    "simulated-annealing": {
      "name": "Simulated Annealing",
      "description": "Simulated annealing is a probabilistic technique used for finding an approximate solution to an optimization problem. To find the optimal solution, the algorithm starts with a large random solution space and iteratively shrinks it down to the best solution."

    "gray-wolf-optimization": {
      "name": "Gray Wolf Optimization",
      "description": "Gray wolf optimization is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting mechanism of gray wolves. The algorithm is based on the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature."

    "harmony-search": {
      "name": "Harmony Search",
      "description": "Harmony search is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the musical improvisation process. The algorithm is based on the improvisation process of musicians in searching for a better state of harmony."

    "particle-swarm-optimization": {
      "name": "Particle Swarm Optimization",
      "description": "Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling. The algorithm is based on the social behavior of individuals in a group."
